## Main Content

- [Home](https://synthesiscoding.com/): Overview of Synthesis Coding, the four principles, and when to use each approach

## Core Concepts

Synthesis Coding rests on four principles:
1. Human Architectural Authority — Humans make strategic architectural decisions; AI implements within constraints
2. Systematic Quality Standards — Same rigor applies to AI-generated code as human-written code
3. Active System Understanding — Engineers must understand what AI generates
4. Iterative Context Building — AI effectiveness compounds as context accumulates
